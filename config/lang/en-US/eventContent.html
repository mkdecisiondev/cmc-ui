	<p>Dear Alumni,</p>
	<p>
		Dr. George Simon, Dr. Sewa Legha, Dr. Harvinder Bedi and the CMC Alumni Association have the distinct honor and pleasure of seeking the grace of your presence with family for the 2018 Alumni meeting to be held in Houston from <b>October 4th to 7th.</b> We have worked hard to make this a memorable experience.

		We were able to secure arguably the best venue in Houston for this event, the recently inaugurated Marriott Marquis hotel in downtown Houston, with easy access to all the downtown restaurants, events, and amenities.
	</p>

	<p>
		Additionally we have also planned for a vibrant and stimulating CME event which includes lectures about topics of contemporary interest delivered by some of the most illustrious among us. Details for this event will follow in future mailings.

	<p>
		Last, but not least, we have also planned a sunset boat ride through Galveston Bay, where we can converse with each other and reminisce about our shared CMC heritage, while we dine on the boat and watch what could be, weather permitting, a gorgeous sunset. (We do however have a 115 person limit for the boat ride and reservations are on a first come first serve basis.) Fees for the boat ride are included in the registration fees.
